# Simple Logo Generator

## Description

This project was constructed in order to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file. Through this project, I learnt about:

- Constructors, Prototypes and Classes
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Jest and testing

The image below shows the application in the terminal.
